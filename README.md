# ClassificationExamples

A Decision Tree is a simple representation for classifying examples.
It is a Supervised Machine Learning where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter.
To learn about it more, we have taken Social media data.

## Understanding of the data
Here we have data about Gender, Age, Salary, Purchased.
We need to classify if a person can purchase or not based on Gender, Age Salary
We can observe that the data is varying much on basis of age.
To visualize the same we have plotted a histogram based on the age group
